1)Difference between http1 vs http2:
    Http1:
          *It works on the textual format.
          *HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
          *It uses requests resource inlining for use getting multiple pages.
          It compresses data by itself.
    Http2:  
          *It works on the binary protocol.
          *http2 is more reliable than http1.
          *HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP(Transmission control protocol) connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any                 other resource.
          *It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
          *It uses HPACK for data compression.
     

 
2)blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript:
    Object:
             *In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties.
              A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their                                 characteristics.
    creating objects in JS:
             *Literally we can create object in javascript and also we can create object by creaing instance(using keyword).\
    Synat:
             object={ property1:value1,
                      property2:value2,
                      property3:value3
                    }
    example:
             var person={ "name": "lavish",
                           "age":  28
                        }
    instance creation synatx below:
             var objectname=new objext();
    example:
             var emp=new Object();
             emp.id=1;
             emp.name="XXX";
             emp.salery=25000;
    we can acces javascript object by using below :
             objectName.property
             objectName["property"]
